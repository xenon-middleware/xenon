What is it?
-----------

Octopus is a middleware abstraction library. It provides a simple programming 
interface to various pieces of software that can be used to access distributed
compute and storage resources. 


Why Octopus?
------------

Octopus is developed by the Netherlands eScience Center as a support library 
for our projects. Several projects develop end-user applications that require 
access to distributed compute and storage resources. Octopus provides a simple 
API to those resources, allowing those applications to be developed more 
rapidly. The experience gained during end-user application development is used 
to improve the Octopus API and implementation.
